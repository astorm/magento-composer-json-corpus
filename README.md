# Magento Module's `composer.json` Files October 2019

This repository contains a corpus of `composer.json` files from Magento modules hosted on `packagist.org`.  This was done in a less than formal way, so some of the files will have a `.json` extension and some will have no extension at all (depending on whether they were download via the GitHub API or a clone/copy from non-GitHub repositories)
